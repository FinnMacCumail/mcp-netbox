# Current Development Phase: OpenAI + LangGraph Agentic Orchestration

## Phase Overview
Complete replacement of Claude Code CLI core functionality with distributed multi-agent system using OpenAI GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini and LangGraph orchestration.

## Core Orchestration Features (Phase 3 Focus)
- ✅ Natural language understanding via OpenAI (tested on 35 real queries)
- ✅ Intelligent workflow orchestration with LangGraph
- ✅ Read-only NetBox MCP tool coordination (working with existing tools as-is)
- ✅ Multi-step query decomposition and result aggregation
- ✅ Performance optimization through orchestration (caching, parallel execution)
- ✅ Progress indication during long operations
- ✅ Clarification dialogues for ambiguous requests
- ✅ Context management within conversations
- ✅ Graceful handling of known tool limitations
- ✅ Enhanced user experience through intelligent result presentation

## Active Development Branches
- `feature/openai-agent-foundation` - Core agent system with OpenAI models
- `feature/langgraph-orchestration` - LangGraph workflow engine
- `feature/tool-integration-layer` - MCP tool dynamic integration
- `feature/conversation-management` - Session and context handling

## Key Technologies
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: Complex reasoning, planning, supervision
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Intent recognition, tool selection, response generation
- **LangGraph**: State machines, workflow orchestration, agent coordination
- **Python**: Core implementation language
- **NetBox MCP**: 142+ infrastructure management tools

## Development Timeline
- **Weeks 1-4**: OpenAI Agent Foundation
- **Weeks 5-8**: LangGraph Orchestration Engine
- **Weeks 9-12**: Tool Integration & Autonomous Execution
- **Weeks 13-16**: Conversation & Context Management

## Current Status
- **Phase Start Date**: January 2025
- **Target Completion**: 16 weeks
- **Current Week**: Planning Complete

## Tested Query Patterns Integration
**Simple Queries** (10 patterns): Basic discovery and listing
**Intermediate Queries** (12 patterns): Detailed information retrieval  
**Complex Queries** (13 patterns): Advanced analysis and reporting

**Known Tool Issues to Work Around**:
- Device types listing problems (Query #7)
- VLANs listing problems (Query #9)
- Interface pagination issues (Query #15)
- Long execution times for complex audits (Query #26: 3+ minutes)

## Success Criteria
- Intelligent orchestration of existing read-only NetBox MCP tools
- Natural language understanding for all 35 tested query patterns
- Enhanced performance through caching and parallel execution
- Graceful handling of tool limitations with user-friendly explanations
- Sub-30 second response for complex queries (down from 3+ minutes)
- Multi-step workflow coordination with progress indication

## Strategic Scope Separation
**Phase 3 Objectives** (This Phase):
- Orchestration layer intelligence and user experience
- Working with existing tools as-is, optimizing through coordination

**NetBox MCP Server Issues** (Separate Development Track):
- Tool performance optimization (N+1 queries, pagination)
- API call efficiency improvements
- Token overflow resolution in tool implementations

## Out of Scope for This Phase
- Fixing NetBox MCP server tool implementations
- Modifying existing tool performance issues
- State persistence/recovery across sessions
- Multi-user concurrency support
- Security/authentication layer
- Production monitoring and observability
