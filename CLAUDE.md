# Claude Instructions for NetBox MCP Server

## Communication Language Guidelines

- **Human Communication**: Always communicate with the user in Dutch
- **Code & Documentation**: All code, documentation, comments, commit messages, and GitHub-related content must be in English
- **Reason**: This maintains accessibility for the international open-source community while allowing natural communication with the Dutch-speaking project maintainer

## Project Context

This is a NetBox MCP (Model Context Protocol) server - a Python project that provides an interface between Large Language Models and NetBox network documentation and IPAM systems. It's an enterprise-grade read/write server that allows LLMs to interact with NetBox data such as devices, racks, IP addresses, and network infrastructure.

The project is hosted as a public repository on GitHub under the Deployment Team organization.

## Development Guidelines

- Always use English for:
  - Code comments and docstrings
  - README, documentation files
  - Git commit messages
  - GitHub issues/PRs
  - Error messages and logs
  - Configuration examples

- Maintain Dutch for:
  - Direct communication with the user
  - Explanations of what you're doing
  - Questions about requirements

## Key Architecture Components

### Self-Describing Server Architecture
The NetBox MCP follows Gemini AI's architectural recommendations:

- **Tool Registry System** (`netbox_mcp/registry.py`): Core @mcp_tool decorator with automatic function inspection
- **Dependency Injection** (`netbox_mcp/dependencies.py`): Thread-safe singleton client management resolving circular imports
- **Plugin Architecture** (`netbox_mcp/tools/`): Automatic tool discovery with clean module separation
- **Foreign Key Resolution**: Intelligent slug/name to ID conversion for all NetBox relationships
- **Enterprise Safety**: confirm=True, dry-run mode, comprehensive error handling, audit logging

### Production Hardening Features
- **Secrets Management** (`netbox_mcp/secrets.py`): Docker secrets, Kubernetes secrets, environment variables

## Important Resources

- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/Deployment-Team/netbox-mcp
- **Issues & Roadmap**: Use GitHub Issues for feature requests and v0.9.0 milestone tracking
- **Milestones**: Development organized by version milestones
- **Docker Hub**: Container images published for production deployment

## Development Workflow

1. **Before implementing new features**: Check the roadmap GitHub Issues and Milestones
2. **API changes**: Always follow NetBox API best practices and foreign key resolution patterns
3. **Testing**: Test against real NetBox instances with preserved test infrastructure  
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation when adding features
5. **Community**: Engage with the community through GitHub Issues for feedback

## Current Architecture Status

**✅ PRODUCTION READY**: The NetBox MCP server has achieved enterprise-grade status with:

- **Self-Describing Architecture**: Complete tool registry and dependency injection
- **Production Hardening**: Secrets management, structured logging, health endpoints
- **High-Level Automation**: First enterprise tool (`netbox_provision_new_device`) implemented and tested
- **Enterprise Safety**: Comprehensive validation, error handling, and audit trails
- **Container Ready**: Docker optimization with graceful degradation and health checks

The foundation is established for rapid development of the remaining 12 high-level tools in v0.9.0, transforming NetBox MCP into the ultimate enterprise automation platform for network infrastructure management.
