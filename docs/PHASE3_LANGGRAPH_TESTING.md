# Phase 3 LangGraph Orchestration Testing Guide

Complete guide for testing the Phase 3 Week 5-8 LangGraph StateGraph orchestration engine with intelligent NetBox tool coordination.

## Overview

The Phase 3 Week 5-8 implementation provides a sophisticated LangGraph StateGraph orchestration system that replaces basic agent coordination with intelligent workflow management. This guide shows you how to test and validate the complete LangGraph orchestration engine.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install and Set Up

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Set your OpenAI API key (required for intent classification and response generation)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"

# Optional: Set up Redis for intelligent caching (recommended)
# Redis will provide 33%+ performance improvements
sudo apt install redis-server  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install redis             # macOS
```

### 2. Run LangGraph Orchestration Tests

```bash
# Quick validation test
python test_final_demo.py

# Comprehensive orchestration testing with realistic queries
python test_realistic_queries.py

# Interactive CLI for manual testing
python test_cli_simple.py
```

### 3. Try Sample Queries

The LangGraph orchestration engine supports three coordination strategies:

```
🚀 NetBox AI> Check NetBox server health
   (Direct strategy - simple single-tool execution)

🚀 NetBox AI> Get detailed information about device dmi01-akron-pdu01  
   (Direct strategy - specific device query)

🚀 NetBox AI> Generate a comprehensive tenant resource report for tenant Dunder-Mifflin, Inc.
   (Complex strategy - multi-tool coordination with parallel execution)
```

## LangGraph Orchestration Architecture

### StateGraph Workflow (5-Node Architecture)

```
START → classify_intent → route_coordination_strategy → execute_tools → generate_response → END
                                    ↓
                         ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
                         │ Conditional Routing:            │
                         │ • direct → execute_tools        │
                         │ • complex → plan_coordination   │
                         │ • limitation_aware → handle_limitations │
                         └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Core Components

1. **NetworkOrchestrationState**: Typed state management with comprehensive workflow tracking
2. **Intent Classification**: OpenAI-powered query analysis with confidence scoring
3. **Strategy Routing**: Intelligent workflow selection based on query complexity
4. **Tool Coordination**: Parallel and sequential execution with dependency management
5. **Response Generation**: Natural language formatting with OpenAI integration

## Testing Options

```bash
python test_cli_simple.py
```

Features:
- Real-time LangGraph workflow execution
- Interactive query testing

## Advanced Features Testing

### 1. Intelligent Caching System

```bash
# Test caching performance (requires Redis)
🚀 NetBox AI> cache-stats

Expected Output:
📊 Intelligent Caching Statistics:
  🎯 Hit Rate: 72.3%
  📈 Total Requests: 45
  ✅ Cache Hits: 33
  💰 API Calls Saved: 33
  ⏱️ Time Saved: 26.4s
```

### 2. LangGraph Coordination Statistics

```bash

  🔧 Total Tool Requests: 127
  ✅ Success Rate: 94.5%
  💾 Cache Hit Rate: 72.3%
  ⚡ Parallel Executions: 23
```

### 3. Strategy Selection Testing

Test each coordination strategy:

```bash
# Direct Strategy (high-confidence, simple queries)
"List all devices"
"Check NetBox server health"

# Complex Strategy (multi-tool coordination required)  
"Generate comprehensive tenant resource report"
"Analyze network connectivity for site"

# Limitation Aware Strategy (known issues or low confidence)
"Show me everything about the infrastructure"
"Complex ambiguous query with multiple entities"
```

## Tool-Specific TTL Configuration

The caching system uses intelligent TTL strategies based on data volatility:

```python
# Infrastructure topology (very stable) - 1-4 hours
"netbox_list_all_sites": 3600,
"netbox_list_all_manufacturers": 14400,

# Device configuration (moderately stable) - 10-20 minutes  
"netbox_get_device_info": 600,
"netbox_list_all_devices": 900,

# Network configuration (changes frequently) - 5-15 minutes
"netbox_get_device_interfaces": 300,
"netbox_list_all_vlans": 600,

# Dynamic status (very dynamic) - 1-5 minutes
"netbox_health_check": 60,
"netbox_get_cable_info": 300,
```

## Limitation Handling Demonstration

### Progressive Disclosure Testing

```bash
# Query that triggers progressive disclosure
"Show all devices across all sites with full details"

Expected Behavior:
⚠️ Large dataset detected (500+ results)
🛡️ Strategy: progressive_disclosure
📊 Showing first 50 results
🎛️ Options: [Show next 50, Apply filters, Switch to summary]
```

### N+1 Query Prevention

```bash
# Query that would trigger N+1 database queries
"Show detailed interface information for all devices"

Expected Behavior:  
⚠️ N+1 query pattern detected
🛡️ Strategy: intelligent_sampling
📊 Processing 10 representative devices
🎛️ Options: [Process next 10, Filter devices, Generate summary]
```

```bash
Warning: "Caching disabled (Redis unavailable)"
Solution: Install and start Redis server, or continue without caching
```

**3. Virtual Environment Issues**
```bash
Error: "No module named 'langgraph'"
Solution: source venv/bin/activate && pip install -e .
```

**4. Import Errors**
```bash
Error: "Cannot import LangGraph components"
Solution: pip install langgraph langchain-openai
```

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Multi-Turn Conversation Testing

```bash
🚀 NetBox AI> Show me all sites
🚀 NetBox AI> Now get devices for the first site
🚀 NetBox AI> What's the rack inventory for those devices?
```

### Error Recovery Testing

```bash
# Test OpenAI API failure recovery
🚀 NetBox AI> [Invalid API key scenario]
Expected: Graceful fallback with informative error message

# Test Redis failure recovery  
🚀 NetBox AI> [Redis unavailable scenario]
Expected: Fallback mode with disabled caching
```

### Performance Stress Testing
