# Claude Instructions for NetBox MCP Server

## Communication Language Guidelines

- **Human Communication**: Always communicate with the user in Dutch
- **Code & Documentation**: All code, documentation, comments, commit messages, and GitHub-related content must be in English
- **Reason**: This maintains accessibility for the international open-source community while allowing natural communication with the Dutch-speaking project maintainer

## Project Context

This is a NetBox MCP (Model Context Protocol) server - a Python project that provides an interface between Large Language Models and NetBox network documentation and IPAM systems. It's an enterprise-grade read/write server that allows LLMs to interact with NetBox data such as devices, racks, IP addresses, and network infrastructure.

The project is hosted as a public repository on GitHub under the Deployment Team organization.

## Development Guidelines

- Always use English for:
  - Code comments and docstrings
  - README, documentation files
  - Git commit messages
  - GitHub issues/PRs
  - Error messages and logs
  - Configuration examples

- Maintain Dutch for:
  - Direct communication with the user
  - Explanations of what you're doing
  - Questions about requirements

## 🏗️ Test-Driven Migration Methodology

### Hierarchical Tool Migration Strategy

Following Gemini's enterprise-grade architectural guidance for migrating from flat tool files to hierarchical domain structure:

#### **Migration Principles**
1. **Clean Removal**: Complete removal of migrated tools from legacy files (git history as backup)
2. **Tool-by-Tool Approach**: Migrate one tool at a time for maximum safety
3. **Immediate Testing**: Run full test suite after each tool migration
4. **Atomic Commits**: Commit only after 100% test success

#### **Migration Workflow** 
```
1. Create new branch for single tool migration
2. Create/update domain module (e.g., dcim/manufacturers.py)
3. Add tool to new location with correct imports
4. Update domain __init__.py for tool discovery
5. Remove tool completely from legacy file
6. Run immediate validation: python -c "test tool registry"
7. Commit only if 100% success: "Refactor: Migrate [tool] to [new location]"
8. Merge successful migration back to main
```

#### **Tool Registry Intelligence**
- **Duplicate Handling**: Registry automatically loads first found tool, skips duplicates
- **No Conflicts**: Migration process ensures clean transitions without tool loss
- **Validation**: Immediate feedback via tool discovery testing

#### **Migration Progress Tracking**
- **Systematic Approach**: Domain-by-domain following dependency order
- **Safety First**: Git reset if any issues occur during migration
- **Documentation**: Each migration documented with clear commit messages

#### **Enterprise Benefits Achieved**
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Domain separation with enterprise patterns
- ✅ **Zero Downtime**: Tools remain available during migration
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: No tool loss or registry corruption
- ✅ **Scalable Structure**: Prepared for future tool expansion

### **Current Migration Results**
- **12/16 DCIM tools** successfully migrated using Test-Driven approach (75% complete)
- **100% success rate** with immediate validation after each migration
- **Clean separation** achieved: 
  - `sites.py` (171 lines): Site infrastructure management
  - `racks.py` (497 lines): Rack elevation and inventory tools
  - `manufacturers.py` (83 lines): Vendor management
  - `device_roles.py` (99 lines): Role-based device categorization
  - `device_types.py` (119 lines): Device catalog with manufacturer resolution
  - `devices.py` (874 lines): Enterprise device lifecycle (provisioning, decommissioning, info)
  - `interfaces.py` (430 lines): Cross-domain interface and cable management
