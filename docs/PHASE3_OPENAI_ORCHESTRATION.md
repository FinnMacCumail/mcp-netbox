# Phase 3: OpenAI + LangGraph Agentic Orchestration

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 represents a complete architectural shift from the monolithic Claude Code CLI to a distributed multi-agent system powered by OpenAI models and orchestrated through LangGraph state machines. This phase focuses on delivering core CLI replacement functionality for development use.

## Core Objective

Replace Claude Code CLI with an intelligent orchestration system that:
- Understands natural language queries using OpenAI (validated on 35 real query patterns)
- Orchestrates multi-step workflows through LangGraph state machines
- Coordinates existing read-only NetBox MCP tools intelligently
- Provides enhanced user experience through result aggregation and progress indication
- Optimizes performance through caching, parallel execution, and intelligent routing

## Why Replace Claude Code CLI?

### Current Limitations (Phase 2)
1. **Performance**: Complex queries take 3+ minutes (tested Query #26)
2. **User Experience**: No progress indication, unclear errors
3. **Cost**: $0.13 per query using Claude API process spawning
4. **Intelligence**: No query optimization or result aggregation
5. **Architecture**: Monolithic CLI with no workflow coordination

### Phase 3 Orchestration Solutions
1. **Performance**: < 30 seconds through intelligent caching and parallel execution
2. **User Experience**: Progress streaming, clarification dialogues, result enhancement
3. **Cost**: $0.001 per query with optimized OpenAI model usage
4. **Intelligence**: Query pattern recognition, workflow optimization, result aggregation
5. **Architecture**: Distributed agent coordination with LangGraph state machines

### Strategic Approach: Work with Existing Tools
**Phase 3 does NOT fix NetBox MCP server issues but works around them**:
- Tool pagination problems → Multiple tool calls with automatic aggregation
- N+1 query issues → Intelligent caching and parallel execution
- Token overflow → Result streaming and progressive disclosure
- Performance issues → User feedback and orchestration-level optimization

## Implementation Plan

    "detailed": ["netbox_get_device_info", "netbox_get_site_info", "netbox_get_rack_inventory"],
    "analysis": ["netbox_get_ip_usage", "netbox_get_tenant_resource_report"],
    "health": ["netbox_health_check"]
}

# Register for OpenAI function calling
for category, tools in READ_ONLY_TOOLS.items():
    for tool_name in tools:
        register_openai_function(tool_name, get_tool_metadata(tool_name))

    - Resolve references (it, that, those)
    - Summarize long conversations
    - Handle conversation branching
```

**Multi-Turn Conversation Support**
```python
# Example conversation flow
User: "Show me the devices in rack A1"
Agent: [Lists devices]
User: "Cable the first one to switch-01"
Agent: [Understands "first one" refers to previous list]
```

#### Essential Features

- **Context Windows**: Manage conversation history
- **Alternative Exploration**: "What if" scenarios

## Technology Integration

### OpenAI Configuration
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Complex reasoning tasks
gpt4o_response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0.7
)

# Fast operations
gpt4o_mini_response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=messages,
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice="auto"
)
```

### LangGraph Configuration
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint import MemorySaver

# Create workflow with checkpointing
workflow = StateGraph(QueryState)
memory = MemorySaver()
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

# Execute with state tracking
result = app.invoke(
    {"query": user_query},
    config={"configurable": {"thread_id": session_id}}
)
```

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Message Format
```python
class AgentMessage:
    source: str      # Agent name
    target: str      # Target agent or "broadcast"
    type: str        # request, response, error, progress
    content: dict    # Message payload
    correlation_id: str  # Track related messages
```

### Example Flow
```
1. User -> ConversationManager: "Find unused VLANs"
2. ConversationManager -> IntentRecognition: Parse query
3. IntentRecognition -> TaskPlanning: Complex query detected
4. TaskPlanning -> ToolExecution: Execute VLAN list
5. ToolExecution -> TaskPlanning: VLAN data
6. TaskPlanning -> ToolExecution: Execute device query
7. ToolExecution -> TaskPlanning: Device data
8. TaskPlanning -> ResponseGeneration: Format results
9. ResponseGeneration -> ConversationManager: Natural language
10. ConversationManager -> User: "Found 5 unused VLANs..."
```

## Error Handling Strategy

### Graceful Degradation
```python
try:
    # Primary approach
    result = execute_optimal_workflow()
except WorkflowError:
    try:
        # Fallback approach
        result = execute_simple_workflow()
    except:
        # Final fallback
        result = explain_limitation_to_user()
```

### User-Friendly Errors
```python
# Instead of: "KeyError: 'device_id'"
# Generate: "I couldn't find the device 'switch-01'. 
#            Did you mean 'core-switch-01'?"
```
