# Claude Code CLI Replacement Validation Checklist

## Overview
This checklist validates that the OpenAI + LangGraph orchestration system provides intelligent coordination of existing read-only NetBox MCP tools, enhancing the user experience and performance over Claude Code CLI.

## Strategic Focus
**Phase 3 validates orchestration capabilities, NOT tool fixes**:
- Working with existing NetBox MCP tools as-is
- Providing intelligent coordination and result aggregation  
- Handling known tool limitations gracefully
- Delivering enhanced user experience through workflow orchestration

## Core Functionality Requirements

### Natural Language Interface
- [ ] **Query Understanding**: System understands natural language queries about NetBox
- [ ] **Intent Classification**: Correctly identifies what user wants to accomplish
- [ ] **Entity Extraction**: Extracts devices, sites, IPs, etc. from user requests
- [ ] **Context Awareness**: Maintains context within conversation sessions
- [ ] **Response Generation**: Provides natural language responses to queries

**Validation Tests Based on Real Patterns**:
```
Simple Query Pattern #2: "Show me all sites in NetBox"
Expected: Orchestrates netbox_list_all_sites with enhanced formatting

Intermediate Query Pattern #17: "Get device type information for Cisco C9200-48P from Cisco"
Expected: Uses netbox_get_device_type_info with manufacturer and model

Complex Query Pattern #31: "Generate a comprehensive tenant resource report"
Expected: Coordinates multiple tools for complete tenant analysis
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- [ ] **Agent Coordination**: Multiple agents work together seamlessly
- [ ] **Task Decomposition**: Complex queries broken into manageable steps
- [ ] **Parallel Execution**: Independent operations run concurrently
- [ ] **Sequential Execution**: Dependent operations run in correct order
- [ ] **Result Aggregation**: Multiple tool outputs combined coherently

**Validation Tests**:
```
Test Query: "Create device 'switch-01' in rack A1 and cable it to 'core-switch'"
Expected: Creates device, then creates cable connection

Test Query: "Show me the power usage for all devices in building-1"  
Expected: Gets devices, then gets power data for each
```

### Read-Only Tool Orchestration
- [ ] **Intelligent Tool Selection**: System chooses appropriate read-only tools
- [ ] **Parameter Mapping**: User inputs converted to tool parameters correctly
- [ ] **Tool Coordination**: Multiple tools orchestrated for complex queries

**Validation Tests Based on Known Issues**:
```
Test Query #7: "Show all device types" (known problem)
Expected: Graceful handling with user-friendly error explanation

Test Query #15: "Get device interfaces for device X" (pagination issue)
Expected: Automatic handling of pagination, complete results

Test Query #26: "Infrastructure audit for site X" (3+ minute performance)
Expected: Progress indication, streaming results, <30 second completion
```

### Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: System continues when individual components fail
- [ ] **User-Friendly Errors**: Technical errors translated to helpful messages
- [ ] **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- [ ] **Fallback Strategies**: Alternative approaches when primary methods fail
- [ ] **Recovery Mechanisms**: System recovers from failed operations

**Validation Tests**:
```
Test: Query for non-existent device
Expected: Helpful error message, suggestions for similar devices

Test: Network timeout during tool execution
Expected: Retry mechanism, user notification if persistent

Test: Invalid parameters provided
Expected: Parameter validation, request for correction
```

### User Interaction Features
- [ ] **Clarification Requests**: System asks for clarification when needed
- [ ] **Progress Indication**: Shows progress during long operations
- [ ] **Confirmation Handling**: Requests confirmation for write operations
- [ ] **Alternative Suggestions**: Suggests alternative approaches
- [ ] **Help & Guidance**: Provides help when user is stuck

**Validation Tests**:

Expected: "Which servers? I can show servers from these sites: ..."

Test: Long-running operation (bulk device creation)
Expected: Progress updates throughout operation

Test: "Delete all devices"  
Expected: Confirmation request with safety warning
```
